# jekyll-theme-schizoid

I use this theme for my <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>-built websites hosted on <a href="https://neocities.org/" target="_blank">Neocities</a>. Others are welcome to use it too if they like. However, I have not tested whether this theme works for <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> (most likely **not** since GitHub is very particular about what gems it allows).
